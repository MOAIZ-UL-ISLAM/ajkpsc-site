            "Welcome to AJK Public Service Commission. Our commitment to

            It gives me an immense pleasure and a sense of accomplishment to
            observe that Azad Jammu & Kashmir Public Service Commission is
            launching its own web site for the efficacious functioning of the
            commission. It will provide easy and quick access to the prospective
            candidates for the Civil Services of Azad Jammu & Kashmir and also
            to the Public in general for providing information with regard to
            the activities of the commission. As we all know, the Azad Jammu &
            Kashmir Public Service Commission is mainly tasked to conduct
            examinations and interviews to select “the best amongst the bests”
            for recruitment in the Civil Services of Azad Jammu & Kashmir; The
            wider publicity on the internet would attract a larger number of
            candidates thus enabling the commission to choose out of the
            enlarged population. Furthermore, the Website of its own would
            facilitate the commission to post on it the syllabus and model
            papers for different slots and outlines of contents for interviews.
            This, in turn, would lead to better preparation of candidates and
            removal of emergent misconceptions. Through website one can get
            complete information about the syllabi and procedure of the
            selection process. The application forms and examination results
            posted at the Website will facilitate the quick flow of information
            to and from the Public Service Commission enhancing the efficiency
            and efficacy of the organization, apart from ensuring the
            transparency of its working. This newly constituted commission which
            is composed of Human Resource Development Experts, Educationists and
            Administrators have solemnly pledged in its very first meeting to
            adhere to the principle of merit and uphold justice, fair play and
            transparency in the selection process strictly. The launching of the
            Website is a leap forward to achieve this noble and pious objective.
            I pray to Allah to bless us with success in achieving these noble
            goals. Amin!
